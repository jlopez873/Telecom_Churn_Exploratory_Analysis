# Telecom Churn Analysis - Readme

This project contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a telecommunication company's customer churn data. The main objective is to identify the key factors that impact customer churn and provide insights to stakeholders for creating action plans to reduce churn.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following files:

1. `churn_clean.csv`: The original dataset containing cleaned customer churn data of a telecommunication company.
2. `Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for the EDA process.
3. `Telecom Churn Exploratory Analysis.pdf`: A comprehensive PDF report detailing the analysis, findings, and recommendations from the EDA.

## Getting Started

To get started with the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages, such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scipy, if not already installed.
3. Open the `Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook in your preferred Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Visual Studio Code).
4. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the EDA and view the results.
5. Refer to the `Telecom Churn Exploratory Analysis.pdf` for a detailed explanation of the analysis, findings, and recommendations.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis conducted in this project consists of the following steps:

1. Importing and examining the dataset.
2. Conducting Univariate Analysis on continuous and categorical variables.
3. Performing Bivariate Analysis between the target variable (Churn) and independent variables.
4. Running chi-square tests to identify the relationship between Churn and independent variables.
5. Discussing the hypothesis test results, limitations, and recommendations based on the analysis.

For a comprehensive understanding of the project, it is recommended to follow along with the Jupyter Notebook and refer to the PDF report.
